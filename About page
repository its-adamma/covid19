Direct community aid since 2017
Mask Oakland is a grassroots initiative that emerged in smoke and fire to provide the most vulnerable in our communities with the simplest recommended tool: respirator masks.

In 2018, we used social media to raise funds for and deliver over 85,000 masks, more than all Bay Area governments. We focus on direct outreach to the homeless in Oakland and also reached provided thousands of masks to Berkeley, San Francisco, Sacramento and Modesto, working with dozens of community organizations to expand our reach.

In 2019 we mobilized again during the short but intense smoke from Kincade Fire, delivering thousands of masks, supporting others replicating our model in Sonoma and beyond, and using our social media presence to demand accountability for fires caused by undermaintained electrical equipment.
